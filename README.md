Wheat Yellow Rust Infection Classification Using Various Deep Learning models

Yellow Rust disease appears as yellow stripes of powder or dust on leaves and leaf sheaths of the wheat crop. This yellow powder comes out on clothing or fingers when touched. The disease can spread rapidly under congenial conditions and affects crop development and yield. Traditional methods for detecting and classifying wheat yellow rust are labor-intensive, time-consuming and often rely on visual inspection by experts

This repository consists of Wheat Yellow Rust Infection Classification using 3 different deep learning models namely VGG19, AlexNet, MobileNetV2, where MobileNetV2 outperformed with an accuracy of 95.53%
